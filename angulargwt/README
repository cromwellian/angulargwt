# AngularGWT: Write Angular Controllers, Filters, Directives in GWT.

WARNING: Recommended that you use SuperDevMode develop, completely untested in DevMode. Uses lots of compiler casting 
magic to reduce code size, but is likely to break when running inside a JVM.

This build is only the lib itself, withbout examples

Currently undone: 
* Maven Archetype to auto-generate starter project.
* More JavaDoc
* Unit tests.
* Transitive dependencies, modules that depend on modules.
* JSO wrappers for the rest of the AngularJs API. I only implemented that which was needed for TodoMVC.
